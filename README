    Wordclock manual README

This package includes the LaTeX source files for building the manual for the
Wordclock. For now there is only a German version of the manual available.

The basis for this manual is the manual provided along with the V0.12 release, 
see [1]. However some modifications have been done. For now in order to get an
overview over the changes done, please take a look at the log history, see [2].
