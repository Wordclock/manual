# Wordclock manual

This package includes the LaTeX source files for building a user manual for the
Wordclock. For now there is only a German version available, which is based on
the user manual shipped along with the official [V0.12][1] release]. Changes
from [V0.13][2] were incorporated also.

Some minor modifications have been done in order to be able to compile the
sources more easily. To get an overview of all of the changes, please refer to
the [commit log history][3].

*But, keep in mind that the manual is not up to date with the current state of
the firmware, so it doesn't cover any of the new functionalities yet.*
